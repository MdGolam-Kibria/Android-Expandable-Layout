# Android ExpandableLayout

##This is a practice project of [ExpandableLayout Library] (https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout)

We'll design this type of sample Android App [first screenshot] with Expandable Layout Feature. Second screenshot is collected from [ExpandableLayout's GitHub repository] (https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout).

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout/master/images/simple.gif" width="250" height="444" />

All data will come from [this API] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/Android-Expandable-Layout/master/RelatedFiles/data.json) in JSON format.

I used here:
- CardVeiw
- RecyclerView
- Retrofit for network call
- Picasso for image loading
- [ExpandableLayout Library] (https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout) for Expand expected view
